PRUNING OF DECISION TREE
IN the decision tree we use to overcome misclassification by using algorithm
overcome classification means purity of data covering all maximum datapoints.
due to these tecqnique problem of overfitting is occured and to reduced these overfitting problem 
we use pruning techqnique.

TYPES OF PRUNINNG TECHNIQUES ARE:
1)MAX_DEPTH:Control leaves of decision tree helping in solving the problem of overfitting.
2)Min_sample_leaf:Here to overcome overfitting we reduced leaf of the tree so purity will decrease.
3)Min_sample_split:Here to overcome overfitting we reduced split of the tree so purity will decrease.
